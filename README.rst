Active Site Representation in First-Principles Microkinetic Models: Data-Enhanced Computational Screening for Improved Methanation Catalysts
============================================================================================================================================

This repository contains the input files for the CatMAP calculations for the three microkinetic models together with the primary features and geometries used to obtain the predicted energetics of the paper `\"Active Site Representation in First-Principles Microkinetic Models: Data-Enhanced Computational Screening for Improved Methanation Catalysts\"`__.

In order to run the CatMAP input files the branch ``thermodynamic_scaler_with_TS_scaling`` of this `CatMAP repository`__ fork is required.
Clone the repository and checkout the branch ``thermodynamic_scaler_with_TS_scaling``, which includes automatic transition state scaling.
